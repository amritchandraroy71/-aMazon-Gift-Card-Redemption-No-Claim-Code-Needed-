Physical Gift Cards: 
The claim code is typically printed on the back of the card. It’s usually a combination of 14 letters and numbers, often accompanied by a scratch-off layer to conceal the code for security purposes. 
Look for arrows or other visual cues that point directly to the location of the claim code on the card’s back. 
Digital Gift Cards: 
The claim code might be included within the email you receive if the gift card was sent electronically. Check the body of the email or any attached documents for a section mentioning the claim code. 
Alternatively, the claim code might be accessible through a link provided in the email. Clicking the link might automatically redeem the gift card balance to your Amazon account. 
Pro Tip:  If you’re unsure about the format of your gift card (physical or digital), consult the email notification or accompanying message you received with the gift.
